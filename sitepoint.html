Wordpress Plugin Development Tutorial - Learn How To Create A Bulk Category Creator Plugin
</h1>
<p>
In this tutorial we are going to take a look into how to create a basic Wordpress Plugin. Our plugin will have an admin page with a basic form element and a submit button and will perform a simple task of creating bulk categories in one go.
</p>
<p>
A lot of times, when we are developing a website or blog on wordpress, we would need to create a lot of categories. Sometimes, it becomes a pain to create categories one by one. So, here we are going to build a plugin which allows a list of comma separated categories to be copy pasted in a textarea. And on clicking a button, all the categories are loaded into the wordpress categories section in a single go. So, you do not need to sit and click on the Add New Category button for every category that has to be created.
